Back into the swing of things at work after spending January off with my first born child.

This has made me realise how precious time is. So if I get an opportunity to do something, I'm doing it.

Less scrolling and more doing.

## Training

I've been back at football pre-season training since the start of February.
Training twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday for the mighty [Papatoetoe AFC](https://www.sporty.co.nz/papatoetoeafc).

Also playing Futsal on Monday's for 'Oscar and Friends', you can check out the standings [here](https://footballfix.spawtz.com/Leagues/Standings?SportId=0&VenueId=39&LeagueId=258&SeasonId=93&DivisionId=6190).

Been trying to run at least 5km a week and I am still continuing my walks during lunch, often with my son in his pram - he loves being in motion.

My bodyweight workouts have fallen off at the moment while I prioritse sleep but I am keen to get back into this (I really want to be able to hold a handstand by the end of the year.)

## This Site

Continuing to build out this blog slowly as I get the time and think more about what I want this site to be.

Tuesday's are a solid bit of time I get to dedicate to this after work and before training.

## Other

Recently bought an [Insta360 Ultra GO](https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/CAMINS14002/Insta360-GO-Ultra-Action-Camera-Standard-Bundle?qr=product_option). Looking forward to capturing commutes to work, precious moments with my son and anything else I can think of.
Haven't bought an action cam since the Go Pro Hero 3 so I am excited to test this out.
